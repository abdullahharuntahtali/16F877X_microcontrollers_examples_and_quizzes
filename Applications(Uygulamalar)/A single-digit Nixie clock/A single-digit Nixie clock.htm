<h2>A single-digit Nixie clock</h2>

<p>A while ago I found a Burroughs <a href="http://positron.jfet.org/nixie-1/B-57xx_B-58xx.pdf">B-5853</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixie_tube">Nixie</a> tube kicking
around in the lab and decided that I should put it to good use.  Since
I only had one of this size, I wanted to make a single-digit display
out of it.  After I saw <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/%7Ejasonrandharper/Nixie.html">Jason Harper's Nixie clock gallery</a>, I decided that one digit really could make a cool clock.</p>

<p>To add to the excitement, I wanted to be able to <a href="http://www.phatnav.com/wiki/wiki.phtml?title=Modulation">PWM</a>
the display, allowing smooth fading and ultra sexiness (you know, for
the ladies :-P) and allow for further expansion, perhaps via a computer
interface. For these reasons, I chose the Microchip <a href="http://www.microchip.com/download/lit/pline/picmicro/families/16c62x/40300c.pdf">PIC16F628</a> microcontroller, which has an on-board <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/serial-uart/">USART</a> and does hardware PWM on one pin.  Moreover, I'm already quite experienced making crap with the 16F628, including <a href="http://images.jfet.org/20031125/imgp1344.jpg">another clock</a>
(I'll make a page dedicated to the Weston Voltmeter clock some time in
the near future), and I've got a metric assload of them lying around.</p>

<h4>Driving the Nixie</h4>

<p>To drive the Nixie, I'm lucky enough to have a stash of <a href="http://positron.jfet.org/nixie-1/74141.html">74141</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_coded_decimal">BCD</a>-to-decimal
decoder / gas discharge tube driver ICs. These are somewhat hard to
find, although you should still be able to get your hands on some from <a href="http://www.mouser.com/">Mouser</a> or <a href="http://www.ebay.com/">EBay</a>.
The outputs are open-collector, so you just hook the Nixie anode to
rectified mains via a 20ish&nbsp;kOhm resistor, connect the appropriate
outputs on the 74141, and you're all set.</p>

<img src="A%20single-digit%20Nixie%20clock_files/uln2003withzener.gif" align="right" height="254" width="378">

<p>Unfortunately, the 74141 is damn expensive (I just checked---it's $7
from Mouser); fortunately, it's not the only game in town.  It turns
out that you can drop some voltage across the Nixie without lighting
it up.  That means you can drive the Nixie from an IC that can't
tolerate the full 170&nbsp;Volt rail by protecting the output with a
Zener diode.  The <a href="http://positron.jfet.org/nixie-1/2001.pdf">ULN2003</a> is an open-collector
transistor array that can withstand 50&nbsp;Volts at the collector
terminals.  Along with a 47&nbsp;Volt Zener this makes a perfectly
reasonable driver (except that you'll need two of them to cover all
the outputs).  Depending on your Nixie, 47&nbsp;Volts might not be
enough to turn off the filaments completely.  In this case, you could
use the <a href="http://positron.jfet.org/nixie-1/2001.pdf">ULN2023</a> (and an appropriately-chosen
Zener) instead, as it's capable of withstanding 100&nbsp;Volts.  An
example of how you'd use the ULN20x3 is shown to the right.</p>

<p>Another option is to use high voltage discrete transistors to drive
the Nixies.  This can take up a lot of board area (and assembly
time, especially if you're not going to have the board fabbed, for example by---shameless plug coming up---<a href="http://www.4pcb.com/">Advanced Circuits</a>).  On the upside, it's virtually guaranteed to work and more or less foolproof.
Jason Harper has written an excellent paper, 
<a href="http://positron.jfet.org/nixie-1/NixieTransistors.pdf">Driving Nixies with Discrete
Transistors</a>, on just this subject.  I recommend you give it a
read.  Another good resource is <a href="http://www.positronic.demon.nl/neon/HowToDriveNixies.html">How to Drive Nixies</a> over at Onno's Electronics Page.</p>

<h4>Supplying the power</h4>

<p>In a perfect world, everyone would run everything on the other side
of an isolation transformer, no one would worry about ground loops,
and everything would be hunky-dory.</p>

<p>This ain't no perfect world.</p>

<p>As you can see from the picture, my clock only has one transformer,
and I'll tell you a secret: it's just a 6.3&nbsp;Volt&nbsp;RMS
secondary running into a rectifier to provide the low voltage rail for
the 74141 and the 16F628.  The Nixie supply is rectified mains, and as
a result it's potentially (heh, so punny) very dangerous.  If you go
building one, don't zap yourself.  In fact, to be safe, put a 1:1
isolation transformer between the wall and the circuit.</p>

<p>The power supply doesn't have to be all that beefy.  In my case, I
use a bridge rectifier on the mains and another on the transformer
output.  Throw caps on the rectifiers (check the voltage ratings!) and
put an LM7805 and a cap on the low voltage one.  "Bam," as the man
says.</p>

<h4>The PIC circuit</h4>

<p>Since the whole thing runs pretty slowly and oscillator timing
isn't critical, I didn't worry about using a nice accurate 20&nbsp;MHz
crystal.  Instead, I rely on the internal 4&nbsp;MHz oscillator in the
16F628.  This frees up pins A6 and A7, which we will use to drive the
decimal points.</p>

<p>For a time reference, I use 60&nbsp;Hertz off the mains, since it's
guaranteed to be <u>very</u> precise (at least over several
days/weeks).  To get it into the PIC, I just put it through a large
(470&nbsp;kOhm) limiting resistor with clipping diodes to the
5&nbsp;Volt rail and ground.  This is better than dividing down the
sine, since you don't have to worry about offset when you clip the
sine wave.  I put the resultant 60&nbsp;Hertz square wave into A4, the
external timer input pin, so that I can use the PIC's tmr0 interrupt
to keep track of the time.</p>

<p>The 74141 has a simple BCD interface which I tie to A3-A0, allowing
me to write a number to port A to display it on the Nixie.  The 74141
has another feature I find useful: an invalid (&gt;10) input causes the
74141 to blank the display.  This is cool because it lets me do PWM
easily using the 16F628's hardware PWM output.  Even though there's only
one output pin, as long as I can use that pin to force an invalid
input, I'm golden.  To do this, I employ a simple wired-OR with the
two most significant bits of the 74141 (since 8 + 4 &gt; 10, I only need
the two high bits to guarantee an invalid input).</p>

<img src="A%20single-digit%20Nixie%20clock_files/wiredor.gif" align="right" height="129" width="287">

<p>It's a little more easily said than done, however, since I need a
low impedance between the data drivers (A3-A2) and the MSBs of the
74141 in order to sink the maximum output current in the low state (a
whopping 3.2&nbsp;mA at .6&nbsp;Volts!), yet I need to be able to
drive both of the inputs high with the PWM output.  To the left is the
circuit I ended up using.  Yup, those are the right resistor
values---B3 needs to supply about 22&nbsp;mA (remember, .6&nbsp;Volt
diode drop) in the worst case!  (Don't worry, the PIC is rated for
25&nbsp;mA per output up to a total of 200&nbsp;mA into or out of A
and B combined; we're not even close to that.)  Perhaps better than my
rambling is the image to the left, which illustrates the wired-OR
circuit.  Note the diodes, which isolate A3 from A2 when B3 is pulled
low (i.e. when not blanking).</p>

<p>As I promised earlier, A6 and A7 drive transistors for the decimal
points (since the 74141 doesn't do decimals, only the 10 digits).  I
had <a href="http://positron.jfet.org/nixie-1/BF859_3.pdf">BF859</a>s lying around from my plasma
tweeter project (description forthcoming, I promise), so I used them
(even though they're a bit overkill with their 300&nbsp;Volt collector
voltage rating).  1&nbsp;kOhm resistors on the bases and we're all
set.</p>

<p>I mentioned earlier that I wanted to allow room for a possible
computer interface.  Though I haven't implemented it, B2 and B1 are
unused, so I could pop in a little code and use the 16F628's USART to
talk RS232.  Or maybe you could, if you're motivated.  A friend of
mine suggested using it as a load average indicator on my office
computer.  Sounds like a plan to me.</p>

<h4>The code</h4>

<p>The PIC is configured to use its internal 4&nbsp;MHz oscillator;
the tmr0 interrupt, PWM hardware, and weak port B pullups are
enabled.</p>

<p>The code that drives the clock is more or less just an interrupt
handler.  Every clock transition on the 60&nbsp;Hertz input causes a
tmr0 interrupt during which, as they say, shit happens.</p>

<p>First, I check B7 and B4, the buttons for advancing the hours and
minutes.  Since the switches <a href="http://japan.maxim-ic.com/appnotes.cfm/appnote_number/287/ln/en">bounce</a>
like bastards, I debounce them in software by requiring the switch to be depressed for four successive 60&nbsp;Hertz periods.</p>

<p>The next step is to increment the counter.  I actually use four
separate registers to hold the time data as sixtieths, seconds,
minutes, and hours.  A little bit of overflow checking at this point
saves a lot of time in displaying the data later.</p>

<p>To do the display, I use a lookup table to convert the counts to
BCD (so 10 becomes 0x10, 24 becomes 0x24, &amp;c).  The lookup table
is placed in the data EEPROM (we have 128 bytes total), since it's
slightly faster (three cycles versus four) to load it from the data
EEPROM than to use a jump table.</p>

<p>Finally, the PWM value is placed in the appropriate register.
Again, I use a lookup table to translate the sixtieth of the second
we're currently in into a PWM value, and once again this table resides
in the data EEPROM.</p>

<p>If you download the code (see below), let the Makefile be your guide; I've written a couple <a href="http://www.perl.com/">Perl</a> scripts to generate the appropriate EEPROM entries.  These may or may not work with programs other than <a href="http://www.iki.fi/hyvatti/pic/picprog.html">picprog</a>.</p>

<h4>The whole picture</h4>

<p>After making the circuit, I mounted the whole thing on a piece of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene">HDPE</a>.  It's
ghetto, but it works.</p>

<p>Of course, I would be remiss if I didn't provide a schematic (<a href="http://positron.jfet.org/nixie-1/nixie-1.pdf">pdf</a> or <a href="http://positron.jfet.org/nixie-1/nixie-1.ps">postscript</a>) of the whole thing (updated 02/20/2005 to fix a couple errors in the schematic), and the <a href="http://positron.jfet.org/nixie-1/nixie-1.tar.gz">code</a> (nominally in <a href="http://come.to/jal">JAL</a>, though almost all of it is just assembler).</p>

<p>A few pictures are <a href="http://images.jfet.org/20040408/">available</a>.  I know the focus is softer than Mama Cass in her prime.  Sue me.</p>

<h4>Fabbed version</h4>

<p>(added 3/2/05)<img src="A%20single-digit%20Nixie%20clock_files/clock-board.gif" align="right" height="445" width="562">

</p><p>After giving the original Nixie-1 to my younger sister, I
decided I wanted another one for my desk at work, so I invested the
time to make a board in <a href="http://www.cadsoftusa.com/">Eagle</a> and sent it off to <a href="http://www.4pcb.com/">Advanced Circuits</a>.  This clock uses a <a href="http://www.sphere.bc.ca/test/nixie.html">B-5440</a>,
since that's what I had lying around, and I added a DB9 with
appropriate connections for when I finally get around to coding up
something useful for the serial interface.
</p><p>If you're interested in making one of these, you can download a zipfile of the <a href="http://positron.jfet.org/nixie-1/clock000.zip">layout</a> ready to be uploaded to 4pcb.com.  The parts (other than the 74141 and the Nixie) are available from <a href="http://www.digikey.com/">Digi-Key</a>.  The only ones that aren't completely standard are
</p><ul><li>the switches: ITT Industries D6-R-90, Digi-Key part number 401-1008-ND
    </li><li>the transformer: Triad Magnetics FS12-090, Digi-Key part number 237-1024-ND
    </li><li>the right-angle DB9 connector: AMP/Tyco HD-20 9-pin D-Sub, Digi-Key part number A23303-ND <b>NOTE:
don't bother stuffing the DB9; I forgot to include polarity inversion
(e.g., a MAX232), so the serial port won't work on this rev.</b>
</li></ul>
<p>The diodes not marked as 1N4148s are 1N4004s or the like.

</p><p><b>Note</b>: although it's not in the schematic, you're going to
want a .1uF ceramic capacitor across D12 to prevent spurious clock
transitions. In addition, R2 is probably too large by a factor of 10 or
so; a 47kOhm is probably perfect.
</p><p>In the process of making this board, I discovered some <a href="http://blog.jfet.org/2005/02/23#2005022302">extremely useful things</a> which you might find interesting.

</p><p>Here's what it looks like stuffed:

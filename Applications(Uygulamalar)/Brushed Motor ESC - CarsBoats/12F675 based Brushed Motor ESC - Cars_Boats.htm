<blockquote>
  <p>This project documents how to build and construct your own
  Brushed Motor ESC for Cars and Boats using a <a href="http://www.microchip.com/1010/pline/picmicro/category/embctrl/8kbytes/devices/12f675/index.htm">Microchip
  12F675 PIC</a> and a small number of standard components.
</p><p>This ESC is an extension of an earlier
<a href="http://www.designsoft.com.au/ahome/rc/PIC-ESC">aircraft ESC</a> and the
reader is referred to the earlier ESC for full
details of the design.
</p></blockquote>

<h2>Background</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>This ESC grew out of an earlier aircraft ESC. A number of
people asked for an ESC with brake and reverse operations that
were suited to Car and Boat operations. While the earlier design
provided basic reverse facilities I decided not to extend the
aircraft design, but rather to revise the design and
produce a project targeted specifically at cars and boats.
</p><p>This ESC operates in a very similar manner to the Team Tekin
"Rebel 2" ESC and offers all of the key features of the earlier
aircraft ESC as well as push-button programming.
</p><p>A futher requirement was the desire to be able to use either
a relay or an H-bridge to provide motor reverse. This project
incorporates both options.
</p></blockquote>

<h2>What this ESC offers</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>This ESC design offers the following features that are fully
  explained in the aircraft ESC documentation:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Safety startup, requires throttle be off to arm ESC.
    </li><li>Signal loss stop, stops motor on loss of valid signal.
    </li><li>Low voltage cutoff, stops motor on low battery voltage (optional,
    not available on H-bridge version).
    </li><li>Variable rate PWM output to reduce noise a low speeds and
    increase efficiency at high speeds.
    </li><li>Programmable throttle response curves with two sample curves.
    </li><li>Slow start to protect gearboxes.
    </li><li>Brake, either hard or soft (optional).
    </li><li>Accurate throttle pulse width measurement.
    </li><li>Accurate software PWM with rates between 7.6kHz and 2kHz.
    </li><li>64 motor speeds for smooth speed control.
   </li></ul>
   <p>In addition the following features are specific to this
   ESC:
   </p><ul>
    <li>Push-button configuration of throttle range, brake, etc.
    </li><li>Configurable brake time prior to switching to reverse,
    between 0 and 5 seconds.
   </li></ul>
  <h3>Push-button configuration</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This ESC has a push button and LED that permit the ESC to
    be configured. The configuration is stored in the EEPROM on
    the PIC and will stay set until reconfigured.
    </p><p>The configuration system permits the configuration of the
    throttle range, the brake to reverse delay, and also the disabling
    of the reverse function.
  </p></blockquote>

<h2>User's Manual</h2>
<blockquote>
  <h3>Important Note</h3>
  <blockquote>
  On power up the ESC will not arm until the throttle is in the neutral position.
  It is possible to perform throttle configuration during this time using the
  configuration system (see below). The ESC also requires the throttle to be
  in the neutral position to rearm the ESC after:
  <ul>
  <li>Loss of receiver signal;
  </li><li>After using any of the configuration modes.
  <ul>
  It is almost certain that you will need to perform throttle configuration the
  first time that you use the ESC. This is because it is very unlikely that the
  factory default options in the ESC will match your radio control unit.
  </ul></li></ul></blockquote>

  <h3>Status LED (Relay version)</h3>
  <blockquote>
  The status LED is ON whenever the brake is active, and off at other times.
  The status LED is also used during configuration (see below).
  </blockquote>

  <h3>Status LED (H-bridge version)</h3>
  <blockquote>
  The status LED is ON whenever the ESC is in reverse, and off at other times.
  The status LED is also used during configuration (see below).
  </blockquote>

  <h3>Configuration of the ESC</h3>
  <blockquote>
  <p><b>Brake to Reverse Delay</b>
  </p><p>To set the brake to reverse delay period press the 'program' switch
  and keep it pressed for the delay period required and the release the button.
  When the button is first pressed the LED will start to flash on and off rapidly.
  The maximum delay time that can be configured is approximately 5 seconds, after 5 seconds
  the LED will show a short on flash and a long off flash. If the button is released
  during this time the maximum 5 second delay is configured.

  </p><p><b>Disable Reverse</b>
  </p><p>To disable reverse in the ESC press the 'program' button and keep it pressed.
  At first the LED will flash on and off rapidly. Then, after about 5 seconds the LED
  will change to a short on flash and a long off flash, keep pressing the burron.
  After another 5 seconds the LED will alter to a long on flash and long off flash,
  now release the button.

  </p><p><b>Configure throttle</b>
  </p><p>To configure the throttle first ensure that the throttle is in the neutral position.
  </p><p>Press the 'program' button and hold it down. At first the LED will flash on
  and off rapidly. Then, after about 5 seconds the LED will change to a short on flash
  and a long off flash, keep holding the burron down. After another 5 seconds the LED
  will alter to a long on flash and long off flash, keep holding the button down.
  </p><p>After a further 5 seconds the LED will return to flashing on and off rapidly,
  release the 'program' button.
  </p><p>The LED will continue to flash on and off rapidly. Pull the throttle to the
  full forward direction and hold it there for a few seconds and then return the throttle to the neutral position.
  </p><p>The LED will change to flashing with a long on and long off, this indicates that
  the forward throttle settings have been configured. Push the throttle to the full
  brake/reverse position and hold it there for a few seconds and then return the throttle
  to the neutral position.
  </p><p>The LED will stop flashing and the ESC's throttle settings are now configured.

<h2>Software Development Environment</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>This software was developed with the <a href="http://www.microchip.com/1010/pline/tools/picmicro/devenv/mplabi/mplab6/index.htm">MPLAB
  IDE</a> from MicroChip.</p>
  <p>If you plan to use this ESC design and build one yourself
  you will need to download the MPLAB IDE. There are too many ESC
  options for all the versions to be available on this Web page.
  With the earlier aircraft design I provided a few 'common'
  versions of the software, however, with this ESC I have assumed
  that anyone building the ESC will select the options and
  assemble the code for themselves.
  </p><p>After you have installed the MPLAB IDE proceed as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create a directory somewhere on your Windows system. the
    MPLAB IDE does not like path names that are too long (greater
    than 30 characters or so) - so stick to a simple short name.
    For example: <i>C:\PIC\CarESC</i>
    </li><li>Copy the caresc.asm, linear.inc and power.inc files from the
    links below into your diectory.
    </li><li>Start the MPLAB IDE.
    </li><li>Select Project-&gt;Project Wizard.
    </li><li>Click Next.
    </li><li>Select 'PIC12F675' as the device, click 'Next'.
    </li><li>Select 'Microchip MPASM Toolsuite' as the Active Toolsuite,
    click 'Next'.
    </li><li>Enter a name for your project and then use the 'Browse' facility
    to set the Project Directory to the directory you created at
    the first step, click 'Next'.
    </li><li>Add the 3 files that you copied to the project directory
    to the project by double clicking each file name in the left
    hand pane, the files will appear in the right hand pane. <b>Do
    NOT check the boxes next to the files.</b> Click 'Next'.
    </li><li>Click 'Finish'.
    </li><li>The workspace will open and you will see a project window
    that shows one Source File and two Header Files.
    </li><li>You should now be able to assemble the PIC code by pressing
    F10 - this will produce a file called 'caresc.hex'.
    </li><li>To alter the paramaters double click on 'caresc.asm' in the
    project window and the assembler source will now appear in a
    new window, make the changes you require in this window.
    </li><li>After you have made you changes press F10 to assemble the
    code.
  </li></ul>
  <p>The MPLAB IDE has full support for simulation that permits
  you to fully check the operation of the ESC. However, the use
  of these facilities is beyond the scope of this document. Users
  who just want to build a 'custom' version by modifying standard
  parameters of the ESC should have no problem just using the IDE
  to assemble the code.</p>

<h2>The ESC Software</h2>
<blockquote>
  <h3>The PWM Engine Generator</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This ESC uses a software PWM engine that is machine generated
    by a <a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a> program. The source
    code for this program is available as part of the earlier
    aircraft ESC. Please consult the other document for details.
  </p></blockquote>
  <h3>Main ESC module</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The main ESC module contains all of the ESC application, with
    the exception of the PWM engine file. This source file contains
    a number of constants at the top that you can modify so suit
    your application.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h3>Linear PWM engine</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>A linear (ie. throttle position proportional to percentage
    duty cycle) PWM include file is available that implements the
    'basic' ESC.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h3>Power PWM engine</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>A power (ie. throttle position proportional to engine power)
    PWM include file is available.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h2>ESC Software Options</h2>
<blockquote>
   <p>This ESC has a number of options that you can configure prior to
   programming the PIC. These options include:
   </p><ul>
   <li>Enable or disable the push button configuration option (default
   is enabled);
   </li><li>Select either relay or H-bridge for reverse (default is relay);
   </li><li>Enable or disable slow motor start for forward and reverse (default
   is fast motor start);
   </li><li>Select the brake mode as either no brake, brake on/off at 100%, brake
   on/off with a slow brake application (the default), or proportional brake;
   </li><li>Low voltage curoff point (default is disabled);
   </li><li>Relay changover delay (default os 0.5sec).
   </li></ul>
   <p>Prior to constucting this ESC you should review the documentation
   at the top of the caresc.asm source module and alter the configuration
   setting to produce the combination of options that you require.
</p></blockquote>

<h2>Circuits</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p>There are 2 circuits available that show the ESC
    in its intended configuration. One circuit uses a relay to
    provide the reverse functions and the other shows a 
    sample H-bridge design.
    </p><p><b>Note</b>: These circuits all show a single FET in each
    position in the curcuit. For large motor currents it will probably
    be the case that more FETs in parallel are required and appropriate
    heatsinks considered. The details of this are left to the reader.
    </p><h3>A note about the H-bridge</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The H-bridge citcuit is provided as a starting point only.
	It is a simple design using two P-channel FETs and two N-channel FETs.
	The P-channel FETS have a relativly high On resistance and in
	most circumstances the use of all N-channel FETs would be more
	appropriate. Replacing the P-channel FETs with N-channel FETs
	requires a more complex drive arrangement and this is not documented
	here.

<h2>Construction Details</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>There are no constuction details provided for this ESC. The example shown
in the aircraft ESC can easily be adjusted for use with the relay reverse
ESC. The H-bridge ESC would require a desgin that was primarily determined
by the details of the H-bridge system.

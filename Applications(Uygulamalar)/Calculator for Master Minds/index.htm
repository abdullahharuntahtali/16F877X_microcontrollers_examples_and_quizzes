<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This piece of equipment (a kind of toy, a gadget, so to speak) is the result of a
weekend/late night project I recently carried out at home, in order to tinker with PICs
and learn how to program these little gems. The calculator sized device shown above <a href="http://www.mystrobl.de/ws/pic/mm47/index.htm#plays">plays</a> a variant of the game called Bulls and Cows (or, in a
variant, Jotto), a guessing game popularized by Invicta Plastics under the name Master
Mind. Being based on a computer, my variant doesn't use colors and pegs, or cards, but
numbers, naturally.</p>

<p>So what does it do? Well, the user thinks up a hidden code (an arbitrary 4 digit number
composed of digits from 1 to 7), then the computer tries to guess it, by offering a
combination. This combination is displayed on the 4 digit LED display. For example, in the
picture above, it shows the combination 1425. &nbsp; </p>

<p>These guesses are in turn rated by the user by using two buttons, telling the computer
how many places are having the correct digit displayed, and how many of the rest are
correct, but misplaced. The computer uses this to select then next try, and so on, until
either the hidden code is known to the computer - or the user is known to have made a
mistake :-). In the former case the computer displays the correct combination and flashes
the decimal points in form of a running light. I the latter case, it displays four zeros
0000, indicating an error.</p>

<h2>Sources and Binaries (download)</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.mystrobl.de/ws/pic/mm47/mm47bas.htm">program</a> is written in a a PicBasic / Assembler mixture. </p>

<p>If anybody would like to build this gadget, and perhaps tinker a bit with the code,
without having access to a Picbasic compiler, please have a look at the very same <a href="http://www.mystrobl.de/ws/pic/mm47/MM47V38.asm">program</a>, but translated into Standard Microchip Assembler language.
It contains no Picbasic statements, no macros anymore, but pure plain Microchip Assembler
code only. This source differs from a straight disassembly by the fact that all program
labels are still there.</p>

<p>For just building the toy, and using my program as a black box, here is the <a href="http://www.mystrobl.de/ws/pic/mm47/MM47V38.HEX">binary</a>, in Intel hex format as produced by the assembler, and as it
is used by most of the PIC programmers. Use a programmer to put the binary into a PIC16F84
(WDT off!), and wire it as described below.</p>

<h2><a name="plays">User interface and instructions for using the calculator</a></h2>

<p>The calculator has two buttons and a four digit display. The left button cycles through
the numbers 0..4, the right key has the role of an enter key.</p>

<p>Initially, the calculator is switched off.&nbsp; Think up a combination (say: 1234).
&nbsp; Remember: use digits between 1 and 7. Neither 0 nor 8 or 9 are allowed.</p>

<p>Now press the left key once.</p>

<p>When the left key is pressed, the processor wakes up and displays the first question,
immediately. For example, it displays the combination 1467. </p>

<p>Here, in this example, it got one position right (the first one), and one additional
digit (4, which is in the wrong position) right. So we have to enter "11", the
first one for a correct position, the second one for a correct number.</p>

<p>We do that by pressing the left button once. Now it displays a "0" in the
position next to the rightmost position, i.e. "<font face="Courier">__0_</font>".
We press the left key again "<font face="Courier">__1_</font>" and enter it by
pressing the right key once. Now we see "<font face="Courier">__10</font>" in
the display. Pressing the left key this time increments the rightmost digit ("<font face="Courier">__11</font>"). Fine, we press the right button (the "enter"
key) again, and after less than half a second, the calculator displays its next guess,
1236 in this example. Now this is almost right, so we enter "<font face="Courier">__30</font>"
by pressing &lt;left&gt; &lt;left&gt; &lt;left&gt;&lt;left&gt; &lt;right&gt;
&lt;right&gt;. The next guess is "<font face="Courier">1136</font>", we enter
"<font face="Courier">__20</font>", then <font face="Courier">1256</font>
("<font face="Courier">__20</font>"). Bingo: the display shows <font face="Courier">1234</font>, and blinks the decimal points as a running light in order to
indicated success.&nbsp; We enjoy it, press one of the buttons for one last time, which
puts the device to sleep, where it consumes less than 2 µA. </p>

<h4>In summary:</h4>

<p>We choose the hidden Code 1234</p>

<h2>History and theory of operation</h2>

<p>This is about the fifth or sixth implementation of that problem I did over the years.
The first implementation was done on a 4 MHz single board computer called Nascom II,
written in Z80 assembler language, a few years after the game was popularized as
Mastermind. The second one was an port of the same algorithm to the same machine, but with
the machine converted into a CP/M computer in the meantime. Then I wrote a version in
G-Level PLI, still on my home-brew CP/M machine. That PLI version got ported to a large
IBM mainframe, later. Etc. </p>

<p>The code breaking strategy is a nice little algorithmic problem to explore new
languages or new architectures with, not as trite as the ubiquitous prime number
generator, but not too complicated either.&nbsp; The computerized game itself isn't very
interesting anymore - Knuth <a href="http://www.mystrobl.de/ws/pic/mm47/index.htm#%5B1%5D">[1]</a> found the optimal strategy for
a specific game (i.e. 4x6) by doing an exhaustive search, one year after the game was
brought to marked by Invicta Plastics, and published it in an article - , but the various
algorithms for different space and time constraints are still interesting, IMHO. </p>

<p>In the case of the PIC, which has barely enough memory for storing the answers,
implementing the generic variant of my algorithm (which finds a good question for an
arbitrary <em>n</em> x<em> m</em> game, by using a variant of the classical
Branch-and-Bound strategy), is completely out of question. So is storing Knuths decision
tables. (Well, perhaps ... hmmm). Anyway, on a mid-range PIC even the solution to the
problem of selecting one element from a set of currently unknown size with equal
probability is not completely obvious. </p>

<p>So for this variant, I had to use the simple minded random strategy, which is
practically almost as good as the optimal strategy (according to Mike Wiener, see <a href="http://www.mystrobl.de/ws/pic/mm47/index.htm#%5B3%5D">[3]</a>).&nbsp; It should find the hidden code in about five tries,
too. I allocated 18 bytes of the 68 Bytes available on the 16F84, giving room for six
answers at most. This leaves a little bit of room for trying different strategies without
having to change the memory layout. Another 16 bytes are necessary for storying four
combinations, while doing the search, uncompressed, for simplicity and speed. </p>

<p>One comparison needs about 150 instructions, or 150µs, on a nominal 4 MHz clock. That
amounts to 150µs*2401 = 1/3 seconds looking at every possible combination after the first
question. When using a 8 MHz resonator, as I did (a 16F84-04 runs quite well even with a
10 MHz quartz or resonator, if one doesn't need the full temperature/Vdd range, no need to
buy the expensive -10 version), the questions usually get computed in less than half a
second. That's fast enough.</p>

<p>A few remarks about the <a href="http://www.mystrobl.de/ws/pic/mm47/algorithm.htm">Algorithm</a>s used will be added on a
separate page.</p>

    is done by the processor and in software. So building the circuit boils down to solder in
    four seven-segments-displays (a 40 pin socket will do, too), a socket for the processor,

<h2>Circuit diagram</h2>

<p>This diagram has been drawn after building the device (using random wiring on a spare
pcb), in order to document it.</p>

<p><img src="index_files/mm47c.gif" alt="Circuit diagram for the Master Mind Calculator" height="583" width="522"></p>

<p>All anodes of all digits are driven by port B (seven segments plus a single decimal
point), by connecting identical pins (i.e. pin 1 of the first display with pin 1 of the
second, third and forth, and so on. Segment <strong>a</strong> to <strong>g</strong>
correspond to PB0 to PB6, <strong>DP</strong>, the decimal point, is connected to PB7.</p>

<p>Four lines of port A are used for multiplexing the four digits, PA0 is connected to the
common kathode of the first (leftmost) digit, and so on.</p>

<p>One port A pin (PA4) is still free and unused. It has to be connected to ground, in
order to reduce power consumption in power-down mode. In addition, two of the port B pins
are connected to a switch (push button), which is connected to ground. There are no
pull-up resistors necessary, because some of the port B pins have weak internal pull-up
resistors, optionally. Multiplexing and sharing a single pin between driving various leds
and sensing the button is done by carefully switching the port B pins between input and
output. For example, during the multiplexing, those two port B pins which are connected to
the switches too, are made input frequently, in order to enable the pull-ups and to check
the switch state. As soon and as long as a closed switch is detected, all pins are held in
input state, in order to avoid short-circuiting a driving pin for more than a few ms. This
method worked remarkably well. There is one drawback - the display is dark as long as a
button is pressed. </p>

<h2>Remarks</h2>

<p>Using about 5 V from a 4 cell, 110Ah Nicad battery pack (from a surplus sale), I
measure between 25 and 30 mA during operation, and about 2 µA in sleep mode. It was
necessary to ground PA4, in order to archive this. (A floating PA4 drives Ipd up to 100
µA and more).&nbsp; That power consumption amounts to about three hours of continous
operation on that battery, or many years of power down mode (theoretically, because it
gets empty because self-discharge, <em>much</em> earlier). </p>

<p>For that reason, I didn't consider a power switch necessary. The device goes into power
saving mode immediately after the display is darkened. When the left button is pressed, it
wakes up again.</p>

<p>Getting the display right required quite a bit of tinkering with the times and the
method. Finally, I used a two-level multiplex, where&nbsp; no more than two segments are
lit at the same time.</p>

<h2>Future enhancements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Automatic power-off after idling for a few minutes. </li>
  <li>Competition mode, where computer and user can change role. Results could be easily
    stored in the non-volatile EEPROM of the 16F84, which is currently unused. Unfortunately,
    the 1 K program space is already almost filled up, so the program would have to be
    reorganized.</li>

The basic idea for a two-wheeled dynamically balancing robot is
pretty simple: drive the wheels in the direction that the 
upper part of the robot is falling.  If the wheels can be driven in such a way as to
stay under the robot's center of gravity, the robot remains balanced.  In practice
this requires two feedback sensors: a tilt or angle sensor to measure the
tilt of the robot with respect to gravity, and wheel encoders to measure the position
of the base of the robot.  Four terms are sufficient to define the motion and
position of this "inverted pendulum"  and thereby balance the robot.  These are 1) the
tilt angle and 2) its first
derivative, the angle velocity, and 3) the platform position and 4) its first derivative,
 the platform velocity.  These four measurements are summed and fed back to the
platform as a motor voltage, which is
proportional to torque, to balance and drive the robot.

<B>Rev 1.</B>  This began as an experiment to learn to control an <A HREF="me_and_pole.jpg">inverted pendulum</A>.
I began with a <A HREF="b01.jpg">three wheeled robot</A> 
with a <A HREF="b04.jpg">ball-bearing pivot</A> used to
attach a 3 foot wooden pole topped with an orange Nerf Ball.  The pivot has a low-friction 5k potentiometer
used for measuring the tilt angle of the pole.  I moved the 
<A HREF="b05.jpg">battery pack over the rear wheel</A> to give
more stability.  Here is an <A HREF="balance3.mpg">mpeg movie (10 Meg)</A> 
of the robot balancing the pole in my office.

<B> Rev 2.</B> After learning to balance the pole, the robot was re-built as a
<A HREF="01-00000.jpg">two-wheel</A> version, with the
battery mounted directly above the wheels.  The ball-bearing  pivot was attached to the 
bottom of the robot with
a <A HREF="02-00000.jpg">short aluminium feeler</A> touching the floor.  In this way the robot can sense it's angle to the
floor and, assuming the floor is level, to gravity as well.  The aluminium feeler has a teflon pad
on the end to help it ride over cracks and joints in the floor.

<B>Rev 3.</B> 
For the third version a third deck was added and the batteries moved to the
<A HREF="b02.jpg">top deck</A>. This allows
the robot to generate more torque without having to tilt over as far.
The <A HREF="../balance/b08.jpg">side view</A> of the
platform shows the battery and user interface on the top deck, the microcontroller and
h-bridge on the middle deck, and the motors and axles on the lowest deck.

<A HREF="../balance/b10.jpg">
<IMG SRC="../balance/b10_xx.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=20></A>

The ball-bearing pivot and angle sensor were replaced by a piezo-electric gyroscope and
ADXL202 accelerometer mounted just above the motor deck.  Those sensors were eventually
replaced by a commerical inclinometer, the 
<A HREF="http://www.microstrain.com/FAS-G.htm">FAS-G</A> from MicroStrain, also consisting
of an ADXL202 accelerometer and a rate gyro, similar to the boards and kits available from

New base and motors for nBot, using the
<A HREF="../Encoder/pitt_html/encoders.html">
Pittman GM8712 DC gearhead motors</a> with home-brew shaft encoders.  These are
powered by 18 NiMH 1800 mAh rechargeable AA cells, at about 24 volts.  They have a lot
more torque at very low rpm than the previous 12 volt motors, as well as higher maximum
rpm.  The result is that the robot is more stable and can respond more quickly.

<B> Balancing.</B> <BR><BR>

The gyroscope and accelerometer are combined with 
<A HREF="../balance/inertial.pdf">complementary filters</A>
to provide an inertial reference sensor.  The ADXL202 accelerometer provides accurate static
tilt information, when the robot is not accelerating.  The gyroscope can be integrated to
provide accurate dynamic tilt information, but the integration tends to 
<A HREF="../balance/log122.plot00.gif">drift over time</A>.



Combining the two sensors provides a robust inertial measurement.  The 
<A HREF="http://www.microstrain.com/FAS-G.htm">FAS-G</A> IMU implements 
a "Weiner" filter to combine the two sensors into a single measurement.  The
<A HREF="http://autopilot.sourceforge.net/">sourceforge autopilot project.</A> and the boards available from
<A HREF="http://rotomotion.com/">rotomotion.com</A> use a "Kalman" filter. Some really good information on
inertial measurement units is available from the

sourceforge autopilot project</a>.

  If a constant offset voltage is added to one wheel and subtracted from the other wheel,
the robot balance is not altered.

If a small offset is added to the tilt angle the robot must remain in motion to stay balanced.
This combined with a voltage offset added to one wheel and subtracted from the other will cause
the robot to drive in a circle.

I think the two-wheel balancing robot will turn out to be <A HREF="advantages.html">more stable</A> than my other three-wheeled robots.
Here is an <A HREF="nbot_ramp1.mpg">mpeg movie </A>
(3.3 Meg) of the balancing robot going up and down a loading ramp.  Notice how it leans
backward as it goes down the ramp, and forward is it goes back up.  
<BR> <BR>

Notice also that it takes several trys to overcome the bump at the start
of the ramp.  The robot initially bounces away, leaning further forward to get enough
torque to climb over the bump and start up the ramp.   

<A HREF="nbot_ramp1.mpg">
<IMG SRC="ramp1ax.jpg" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT></A>

At the top of the ramp the robot
touches the left wall.  At this stage in development it has no sensors to detect collisions.
The balance algorithm bounces it along the wall until it is finally free at the corner. In
its final version it will have sensors and behaviors to avoid running into things, but note
that the robot does not lose its balance and fall over when it does collide.

<IMG SRC="nbot2/nbot3_rampxx.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 ></A>
<A HREF="nbot2/nbot3_ramp2.mpg"> 
Here is a video (5.2 Meg)</a> that shows what happens when you try to run down-hill too fast without
wearing your helmet. In order to slow down the robot must first speed up, to get the wheels
underneath and eventually out ahead of the center of gravity.  If the robot is going too fast, it
is unable to speed up, and hence unable to slow down.  Also includes some successful attempts. 

<BR CLEAR=LEFT>

So I started the robot at the bottom of the ramp further away from the wall, hoping that
the odometery errors would be small enough that the 'bot could made several runs up and
down.  Instead, it climbed the ramp smoothly and then 
<A HREF="nbot_ramp2_big.mpg">fell off the side (2.8 Meg mpeg)</A>
coming back down.  Ouch!  Time to think about installing those sensors...

a potentiometer driven by a lever and ping pong ball that rests on the floor.  Ron uses a home-brew
CPU board with an ATMEL controller and on-board H-bridge. [Ron, where did your site go?]

Jack Wu and Jim Bal at Carnegie Mellon University have constructed
<A HREF="http://www.wulabs.org/bbot.html">BBot</a> as a semester design project for the Fall of 2003, 
"a self-balancing two-wheeled robot."  Based on their 68 Meg mpeg video, it doesn't appear to actually
be balancing yet...  (Note: link no longer working as of 07 July 04.  I guess school's out)

Lee Magnusson at MIT is working on a 
<A HREF="http://zebrahead.mit.edu/">
self-balancing unicycle</a>. His page has links to some videos and a pdf report.  From the videos
it looks like the human rider still has to do the side-to-side balancing.  Cool nonetheless!
(This link also not working as of 07 July 04.  The college sites must go down at the end of the semester.)

The Technology Department of the Bolton School in Manchester, England, has built this nifty single
wheel cycling robot which they call the
<A HREF="http://www.boltontech.org.uk/loony_cycle.htm">Loony-Cycle</a>.   I believe this design has to
stay in motion in order to maintain balance.  It is steered with propellers that are arranged at 90 degrees
to the direction of travel.
